# Driver Drowsiness Detection

## Overview

Driver Drowsiness Detection is a real-time application designed to monitor driver alertness and detect signs of drowsiness. Using computer vision techniques, the system analyzes the driverâ€™s eyes and triggers an alarm if drowsiness is detected, enhancing road safety.

## Features

- Real-time detection of driver drowsiness based on eye aspect ratio (EAR)
- Audio alert to notify the driver when drowsiness is detected
- Visual display of the EAR and drowsiness status

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pygame

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `pygame`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dg1198/DriverDrowsinessDetection.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DriverDrowsinessDetection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy scipy pygame
   ```

4. Ensure the following files are present in the project directory:
   - `alarm.wav`: The sound file played during a drowsiness alert.
   - `haarcascade_lefteye_2splits.xml`: Haar cascade for left eye detection.
   - `haarcascade_righteye_2splits.xml`: Haar cascade for right eye detection.
   - `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: Haar cascade for face detection (included with OpenCV).

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python detect.py
```

Make sure your webcam is connected and accessible. The program will open a window displaying the video feed. 

- Press the `q` key to exit the application.
